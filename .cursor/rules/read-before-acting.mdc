# Read Before Acting

Before making assumptions, decisions, or modifications, read all relevant files in full and build a clear understanding of the existing codebase.

- Do not infer architecture, intent, or behavior from partial context.
- Examine dependencies, data flow, naming patterns, and surrounding logic to understand how components interact.
- Base all reasoning and changes on the actual implementation, not assumptions.
- Only propose solutions or modifications after forming a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the current system.
