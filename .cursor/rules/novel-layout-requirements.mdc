# Novel Layout Requirements

This project uses a new, never-before-seen layout management solution.

- Do not assume any standard UI/layout behavior or conventions.
- Do not infer or "fill in" missing behavior based on common frameworks.
- Treat all layout logic as undefined unless the user explicitly specifies it.
- Ask for requirements whenever layout behavior is unclear.
- Implement the novel layout solution exactly as the user specifies.
- Prioritize explicit user instructions over best practices, defaults, or typical patterns.
